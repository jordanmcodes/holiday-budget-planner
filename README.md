## What is the purpose of the application?
The purpose of this application is to help people with their basic travel budget needs. Going on holiday is an exciting time.
But also, a stressful one if you don't come prepared. This is why the application is basic, simple to read, and will allow you to knuckle down to the basics of travel.
For example, hotels, flights, food, and activities I have researched is the four basic components when budgeting for a trip.

The application is easy to use and flows smoothly. You are addressed with the introduction sentence, followed by a sentence targetted at making the user feel comfortable.
This is followed by the button that confirms your budget, and the table which allows user input for the four most important categories of travel budgeting.

## User interaction

When you are first loaded into the application, and read through the introduction text, users will feel obliged to click the button to start the process. They will, however, be met with a message that appears below the button, stating they must enter in their pre-holiday budget. This is the figure they will begin their budgeting plan with. Say £500, for example. Once they have clicked on the button afterwards, their budget will be displayed below. Only by entering in their expenses into the table, and re-entered the button, will the budget change.

## Application setup
The application is separated into three pages internally. Those being the HTML, CSS, and Javascript pages. These will each have their own code that will allow the simple application to run. The HTML is where the bulk of the work is, hosting the header, paragraphs, and the table, for example. The CSS is where I styled the application. For example, changing the background to lightcyan, and moving the buttons from the left-hand side of the page to the center. The Javascript page is where I created the functions that allowed the button and the table to work hand-in-hand.

## Visuals/Styling
The page benefits from its simplicity, and that is reflected in the styling choices. Everything is centered towards the middle of the page, styled through classes. The buttons, for example, were created using divs so that they can have their own styling. As for the text itself, I ensured that it remained consistent throughout, with 20px for the size, and Verdana for the font.
